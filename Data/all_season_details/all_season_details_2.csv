There's an area on that pitch that's very dry and the other end is full of grass so I think the spinners need to execute from that end in particular. It's a new surface. I tried to get information from the guys. It's tricky trying to get accustomed as fast as possible. [On being dropped on 14] It's always good to get some luck.

It is about playing what is in front of us and focussing on the here and now. He (Holder) brings some good balance with the bat and the ball - it is fantastic to have in T20 cricket. The Impact Player rule adds another dynamic. Disappointing for him (Prasidh Krishna) to be injured but it gives someone else an opportunity to step up. (On importance of playing spin) Very important. It has been a prevalent part in T20 cricket wherever you play so it is exciting to play in different venues and in different venues - that is part of what makes the IPL special. </p><p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad XI:</strong> Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Harry Brook, Glenn Phillips (wk), Washington Sundar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar (c), Adil Rashid, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Umran Malik, T Natarajan</p><p><strong>Rajasthan Royals XI:</strong> Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder, R Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Trent Boult, KM Asif</p><p><strong>3pm</strong> Time for the toss.

The pitch looks pristine and according to Sanjay Manjrekar, it looks very much like an English pitch - white in colour with an even covering of dry grass. It is a black soil surface, meaning that there might not be a lot of turn for the spinners. A few cracks here and there but he does not expect it to play much of a part. Manjrekar reckons captains winning the toss might want to chase, considering this is a high-scoring venue. </p><p><b>If you are seeing this on a mobile device and didn't know it already, ESPNcricinfo is better experienced on our apps.

SRH, meanwhile, stitched together a superb mid-season run last campaign, only to lose steam when it really mattered. Both teams have had a chance to plug the holes that surfaced in 2022, and on paper, <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/sunrisers-hyderabad-vs-rajasthan-royals-4th-match-1359478/match-preview"">seem better placed</a> to go the distance than they did twelve months ago. </p><p>SRH, though, will have to contend with the unavailability of a few key players today. Aiden Markram (their captain), Heinrich Klaasen and Marco Jansen are currently on national duty. But in Harry Brook, Glenn Phillips, Mayank Agarwal and Rahul Tripathi, they have more than enough firepower to offset it. Keep an eye out for Abhishek Sharma too, who seems to have grown in stature over the past couple of years. </p><p>RR, meanwhile, would be hoping that their explosive batting unit comes to the party again. Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson and Yashasvi Jaiswal can tee off from the outset, and with Shimron Hetmyer adding impetus in the middle order, they seem to have most of their batting bases covered. </p><p>This, however, is also a contest between two strong bowling units. SRH have packed their bowling attack with top-quality Indian pacers - each of whom have a point to prove. RR are missing Prasidh Krishna but have arguably the best spin-bowling contingent at the IPL. </p><p><strong>2:25pm</strong> Three games into the season and we have already had several talking points. It began with <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2023-gt-vs-csk-motera-goes-yellow-in-anticipation-of-dhoni-s-last-dance-1365997"">Ahmedabad being painted yellow</a>, and Hardik Pandya getting the better of MS Dhoni. </p><p>Yesterday, we had rain-induced drama in the afternoon fixture, before Mark Wood produced a storm of his own to blow the Delhi Capitals away. Today, the caravan moves to Hyderabad, where the Sunrisers Hyderabad would hope to become the fourth team to register a home win at the first time of asking. But they will have to do so against Rajasthan Royals, who were last season's finalists. </p><p>Hello and welcome to our coverage, this is Shashwat Kumar and I will be your eyes and ears for everything that happens.
