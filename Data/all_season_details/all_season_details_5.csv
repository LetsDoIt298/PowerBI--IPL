<p>A one-sided game in what was Eden Gardens' first IPL match in four years. KKR cruised to an 81-run win after hitting back from a position where everyone except Thakur had given up. Have a read of <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-9th-match-1359483/match-report"">Monga's report</a> from today's play, which included RCB collapsing from 44 for 0 to 61 for 5. That's it from us tonight, as this is Himanshu signing off on behalf of Raghav, Thilak and Monga! Good night.</p><p><strong>Shardul Thakur is the Player of the Match</strong> for his match-turning 68 off 29: ""Even I don't know where it came from! Looking at the scorecard, everyone would have said we were struggling. But your subconscious mind takes over. You also have to have skills to do that at the higher level, but we also work hard in the nets. Coaching staff do the throwdowns, and give us the option of range-hitting. And you know the pitches; they always suit the batsmen, don't they? Suyash bowled exceptionally well, and we know the quality Sunil and Varun have. They have fun, take wickets. This was a perfect day""</p><p>KKR captain <strong>Nitish Rana</strong>: ""If you look at the last match, there were positives; we were in the game even after seven down. Even today, we collapsed, and credit to Gurbaz. And it was an unbelievable innings from Shardul Thakur! People will talk about Shardul, but Rinku held one end up, as we had planned. We had always planned not to give RCB batters pace in the middle overs. Suyash, playing his first match, bowled brilliant balls to such batters. Not even we have got to know him so far! He backs himself. It was always our plan to add him if we needed a third spinner.""</p><p><strong>Time for the presentations</strong></p><p>Shrikant : ""23 extras by RCB was another crime committed ""</p><p>KKR coach <strong>Chandrakant Pandit</strong>: ""It's a good win. Boys have shown the character. Looking at the initial stage, having lost wickets, and coming back to get 200-plus. We just expected the pitch to help the spinners. But you require enough runs. Shardul and Rinku counterattacked the opposition. We have seen him (Suyash) at trial matches. He is very quick in the air, and it's very tough to pick him. It's just the inexperience; but he showed a fighting attitude.""</p><p>RCB captain <strong>Faf du Plessis</strong> after the loss: ""We had it set up there in the 12th or 13th over... It was probably 20-25 runs too much. Shardul played well. Their legspinners got on top of us. It was still a good wicket... but the nature of mystery spinners is that they get wickets. They put the squeeze on us. We were pretty average with the bat. You learn lessons. Two or three days ago, you played brilliant cricket. It got away from us.""</p><p>Afeef: ""Shardul's knock will remain one of the best knocks when this season ends""</p><p><strong>11.09pm</strong> Hardly a challenge here from the Royal Challengers. KKR were 89 for 5 in the 12th over of their innings - including having Russell back in the hut - but Thakur turned the screw thereon, and how! Strangely, only three KKR batters entered double figures, but you can imagine the impact they had as their side ended at 204. Add to that not one, not two, but three mystery spinners: four wickets for Varun, three for debutant Suyash and two for Narine, and that was it. Hang around for the presentation formalities.</p>"

<p><b>7.30pm</b> Mayank Agarwal and Anmolpreet Singh are in the middle. Kyle Mayers, the specialist first-over bowler, will open the bowling. No slip - Thilak reminds me Mayers bowls inswing predominantly.</p><p>Gul: ""Why was Abishek dropped? Is he also unwell? I dont see any other reason for dropping him :|"" --- Think since they needed a keeper, they replaced Abhishek with Anmolpreet.</p><p>Prakash: ""Finally some innovative use of the impact sub rule. SRH have kept all 3 options open( batter, allrounder or bowler) depending on match situation.""</p><p>Amit: ""Am I the only one confused here? SRH don't have a keeper, unless they sub Klassen"" --- Anmolpreet Singh can sort of keep.</p><p>Chandan: ""They will Substitute Klassen in place of Anmolpreet or Agarwal later in this innings...(that's the only logical way I see his inclusion as Substitute)"" --- And if they need a batter for just one or two overs, they can bring in Jansen as well.</p><p>Hari: ""So Naveen-ul-haq gets the cap but he is not there in the playing XI?"" --- Yeah, a bit strange. Maybe he was in bat-first XI - just my guess. I don't think even that makes much sense.</p><p>Mannan: ""I don't seem to comprehend this SRH lineup. Why use Klaasen as specialist keeper? This is just wastage of impact player rule. Klaasen should've been included in the first innings in the place of Natarajan and Natarajan should've been used as an impact sub for Anmolpreet"" --- I think they will call up Klaasen if they collapse, else they get an extra bowler in Jansen or Farooqi in the second innings.</p><p>So after all that build-up, there's no de Kock.

<p>RajatMaheshwari: ""The only option LSG have if they want to play QDK is to drop Stoinis...he hasn't gotten away in both the matches and hasn't bowled either.

Both teams are coming off a defeat but have also been bolstered by the availability of their South Africans players. Quinton de Kock is back for LSG, and have given them a happy headache. Do they drop Mayers, who has smashed two half-centuries in two games. Or do they leave out one of Stoinis or Pooran? And if both de Kock and Mayers play, who should open? Do let us know what you think.</p>",
