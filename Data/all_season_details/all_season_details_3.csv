Both are making their T20 debut as well. <b>Sampath</b> tells me last time a team had two T20 debutants in an IPL game was Delhi Daredevils in 2018 (Sandeep Lammichane and Abhishek Sharma).

He was supposed to be a key player for India at the T20 World Cup last year but didn't get to play even one game.

At that auction, they went in with a dream. The dream of having Jofra Archer and Jasprit Bumrah bowl in tandem for them. They knew their dream wouldn't become a reality immediately - Archer was not available for the 2022 season. But now with Bumrah out with a back injury, they will have to wait for yet another season. Having said that, they seemed to have got their batting might back. You can read more about what to expect from today's game in our <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/royal-challengers-bangalore-vs-mumbai-indians-5th-match-1359479/match-preview"">preview</a>.</p><p>RCB have been pretty consistent of late, making the playoffs in each of the last three seasons. This run has also coincided with them not playing at their home ground, M Chinnaswamy Stadium - theirs is one of the poorest home records for an IPL team. This season, they play six of their first eight games in Bengaluru, which could dictate how their campaign goes.</p><p><B>6.30pm</b> Hello and welcome to the second game of Super Sunday. It's Royal Challengers Bangalore taking on Mumbai Indians in Bengaluru. RCB's quest for their maiden IPL title is still on, while Mumbai will be looking to bounce back after a forgettable 2022 season where they finished at the bottom of the points table.</p>","<p>LG: ""Technically this ""impact player"" is the same as ""super sub"" the ODIs used to have in early 2000s? "" --- You can say so but there's one big difference. You had to name your XI and Supersub before the toss. Now the teams can name their XI after the toss and bring in an Impact Player from the list of substitutes anytime during the match.</p>"

Good night! </p><p><B>Faf du Plessis is the Player of the Match:</b> It was a nice way to start the way we did in the powerplay. Siraj with his tail up is a beautiful thing. The bowler stuck to their task The last two or three overs, was a bit of learning. The cutters were working really well, it was not easy to hit the ball. There was value for your shots. Credit to the groundsman. Even the spinners found something. [On the crowd] It's awesome to play. It's my first time playing here as a home player, especially batting with Virat Kohli. [Fielding] You have to try and stay with the youngsters. I try and push the old hamstrings so that I can move in the field. To start the campaign with a bang, was huge. </p><p>Presentation time</p><p><b>Virat Kohli</b>: Phenomenal win. Homecoming after so many years. Credit to their batters for getting to that score. Tilak batted well. We kept backing ourselves. Faf went first, and I joined later. I am very happy with how things went today. The new ball was a bit tricky, but we shifted the momentum by taking them down with the new ball. We nullified all their intensity. The wicket was quite a nice one. We hit good areas and kept putting pressure on the bowlers. [Crowd] Phenomenal, was a packed crowd. Every seat was full and we knew we would get  a lot of support. We just ride off that intensity from the crowd They were right behind us. [On Karn Sharma] He was phenomenal, when he got that left-hander out, that was great bowling. He was bowling so well last year. He was ready to play. Even in the nets, he was not getting hit for sixes. He put us on the front foot right away. The first game of the IPL, and to perform like that was great. Apart from Mumbai winning five times and Chennai four times, we have qualified the most number of times, so we do play consistent cricket. It's just about staying focused, and just try to be the best balanced team. We need to play on this momentum. We just need to execute better. </p><p><b>Rohit Sharma</b>: Didn't have a great start but was a good effort from Tilak at the end. But the bowlers didn't bowl well. We didn't bat good enough, it was a good pitch. [On Tilak] Some of the shorts he played today, he showed a lot of courage. We wanted to be courageous enough, and hats off to Tilak for getting us to the total. Was a good pitch to bat on. We did not bat to our potential. 30-40 runs would have been ideal. We were struggling t play the catch-up game. [No Bumrah] For the past six-eight months I am used to play without Bumrah. We can't control things which we can't control. The other guys are also talented. A lot of the guys haven't played IPL before. First game of the season, lot to look forward to.</p><p>Afeef: ""A perfect return to the Chinnaswamy ""</p><p>Shrikant : ""I liked the move to send DK though it has not worked out. RCB is keeping an eye on NRR early on ""</p><p>Neeraj : ""Kohi wanted his own 'finishes off in style' moment...""</p><p><b>11.08pm</b> Everything that could have gone right for RCB, did. Everything that could have wrong for Mumbai, did. Think that's the best way to put. Mumbai, bar Tilak Varma were all over the place, and still got to 171. But RCB openers, Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis just showed how good a surface that was. The duo added 148 runs off 89 balls to set-up the chase. Kohli remained unbeaten on 82 off 49, while du Plessis scored 73 off 43. RCB mopped up the win in just 16.2 overs and that will give their net run-rate a boost.</p>"

<p><strong>7.27pm</strong> The two umpires stride out to the middle. The two Delhi Capitals batters, Prithvi Shaw and David Warner, who is on 5973 IPL runs, also come out. The Titans fielders are in place. Mohammed Shami will take the new ball. Watch out for the nip-backer into Shaw. All set. Warner to take strike. Over the wicket. One slip in place. </p><p>Afeef: ""Tough call to bench Rovman Powell ""</p><p><strong>Subs available for Titans:</strong> R Sai Kishore, Vijay Shankar, Jayant Yadav, Abhinav Manohar</p><p><strong>Subs available for Capitals:</strong> Lalit Yadav, Rovman Powell, Chetan Sakariya, Manish Pandey, Khaleel Ahmed</p><p><strong>Playing XIs</strong></p><p><strong>Gujarat Titans:</strong> WP Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, B Sai Sudharsan, HH Pandya (capt), DA Miller, R Tewatia, Rashid Khan, JB Little, AS Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami</p><p><strong>Delhi Capitals</strong> P Shaw, DA Warner (capt), MR Marsh, SN Khan, RR Rossouw, Aman Hakim Khan, AR Patel, Abishek Porel, Kuldeep Yadav, A Nortje, Mukesh Kumar</p><p><strong>Toss:</strong> David Warner has the coin. <strong>Hardik Pandya calls correctly and Titans will bowl first</strong>. </p><p><strong>David Miller comes in for Williamson, while Sai Sudharsan replaces Vijay Shankar. </strong> For Delhi, <strong>Rovman Powell makes way for Anrich Nortje, while Abishek Porel gets his maiden DC cap</strong>.</p><p><strong>Pandya</strong>: Losing Kane, we are gutted as a team but more for him. We have to move on and Miller comes back for Kane, and Sai Sudharsan comes in for Vijay Shankar. We didn't play our best cricket, but we still won in the first game. We just tried to keep things simple. That's something we are focusing on.</p><p><strong>Warner: </strong> Looks like a nice wicket. We have to come out with a positive intent and put up a good score. [Homeground] Its awesome and hopefully we can put a good score for the crowd. Rovman is out. Abiskeh Porel comes on. Having another left-hander is crucial . There have neem a few harsh calls. We need to bat better, bowl better and field better than the opposition. </p><p> </p><p>Toss in ten minutes. Changes expected in both sides. Both Miller and Nortje are warming up.

""</p><p><b>Here's Aaron Finch with his pitch report:</b> The dimensions are 64 metres either side and 70 metres down the ground. It is the centre wicket. Not a blade of grass when the Test was played here, but there is a nice even covering of grass. Unbelievably flat wicket and I expect there to be a little more seam and carry for the fast bowlers. There are a couple of parts on the wicket that are very dry, they are still hard, though and they will not have a huge influence. 165 is the average score here. The trend so far in the IPL has been to chase, but personally, I would not be against batting first, putting a big total and then put pressure on the teams.</p><p><strong>6.50pm</strong> In other news, KKR's Shreyas Iyer and RCB's Rajat Patidar have been ruled out of IPL 2023. Iyer will <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shreyas-iyer-to-have-back-surgery-out-of-ipl-2023-wtc-final-1366846"">undergo surgery</a> on his injured back and will therefore miss the entire 2023 IPL, and the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June.

Miller should come in straight for Kane Williamson, you'd expect. Nortje's pace should come handy on this Delhi surface.

Certainly, the surface for this game will be expected to be much better for batters.  Both sides are also waiting to see if their South Africans will be available: David Miller, Lungi Ngidi and Anrich Nortje were on the same flights from Johannesburg to Delhi, via Dubai.

<p><b>6.30pm</b> Hello and welcome to Match No.7 of IPL 2023, where we have Delhi Capitals taking on Gujarat Titans as Delhi return to their home territory. Both teams have had contrasting starts to their campaign. While Titans got the better of Chennai Super Kings <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/gujarat-titans-vs-chennai-super-kings-1st-match-1359475/full-scorecard"">by five wickets</a> in the opener, Capitals were decimated by Mark Wood's <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/lucknow-super-giants-vs-delhi-capitals-3rd-match-1359477/full-scorecard"">fiery five-for</a> in Lucknow. Can Capitals stage a comeback at home or will the defending champions continue their winning spree?
